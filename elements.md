<h2 id="content">Sunday School</h2>
<p>We believe that Children are the most important people in the Church. Jesus said,<blockquote>“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”</blockquote> We strive to follow Jesus example of putting Children in the midst of our Church. We believe investing in our young members would be the most strategic use of our resources and it would bear the most fruit for the Kingdom of God in the future.</p>
<p>
We desire for all the children who come through our doors to know that they matter and that God loves them. This is best communicated through relationships and through fun, interactive Bible lessons. We have many wonderful leaders who are passionate about kids and committed to sharing God's love with children. We pray that your children experience the love of Jesus through the Children's Ministry at Life Builders Community Church.</p>
<p>
Every Sunday, while older members of the family attend the church service, Children attend the Sunday School.</p>

<h2 id="elements">Women’s Coffee Fellowship</h2>

<p>Our ladies group meets together regularly on a monthly basis, generally in a café for friendship and fellowship, and be encouraged in their walk with the Lord. We study a variety of topics from the Bible. We aim to foster meaningful relationships amongst women who want to follow Jesus. These relationships provide accountability, encouragement, and prayerful support as the women <i>"walk hand-in-hand towards godliness."</i>

<h2 id="protsahan">Protsahan - a Student Empowerment Program</h2>
<p>
In early 2018 the trust “LBCT” started the 'Protsahan' Tutorial program in Dumka, for underprivileged school children in classes VI and VII. Based on our initial
assessment of the gaps the objective of Protsahan is to assist the children not only in their school curriculum, but also to prepare them early on for competitive exams in the future.
</p>
<p>
The program endeavours to teach and train young students in English, Maths and Science, being the core-curriculum of the tutorial. 
</p>
<p>
In the last one year, Protsahan students have showed tremendous potential to
grow and develop their educational and social skills which is a source of huge
encouragement to LBCC.
