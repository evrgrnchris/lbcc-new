“ Let there be real harmony so that there won't be splits in the church. I plead with you to be of one mind, united in thought and purpose”  1 Cor.1:10

The purpose of the church is summarized is a single structure based on three key scriptures

**1. The  Great Commission**

*"Teacher, which command in God's Law is the most important?"  Jesus said, "'Love the Lord your God with all your passion and prayer and intelligence.' This is the most important, the first on any list. 39 But there is a second to set alongside it: 'Love others as well as you love yourself.' These two commands are pegs; everything in God's Law and the Prophets hangs from them." Matt.22:36-40*

**2. The Great Commandment**

*Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." Matt 28:19-20*

 **3.  The Great Climax**

*The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever." Rev.11:15*
