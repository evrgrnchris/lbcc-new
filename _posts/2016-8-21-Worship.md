**Our Worship Style**

-Celebration "I rejoiced with those who said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD."  Ps.122:1"

-Inspiration “but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint. Isaiah 40:31"

-Preparation " “It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up”  Eph.4:11,12"
