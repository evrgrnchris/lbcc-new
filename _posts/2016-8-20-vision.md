It is the dream of a place where the hurting, depressed, the frustrated, and the confused can find love, acceptance, help, hope, forgiveness, guidance and encouragement.

It is the dream  of sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ with the residents of various language groups in, around and beyond Kolkata.

It is the dream of welcoming 5000 members into the fellowship of our church family – loving, learning, laughing and living in harmony together.

It is the dream of developing people to spiritual maturity through Bible studies, small groups, seminars, foundation course, retreats, etc
