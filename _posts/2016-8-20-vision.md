It is the dream of a place where the hurting, depressed, the frustrated, and the confused can find love, acceptance, help, hope, forgiveness, guidance and encouragement.

It is the dream of sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ with the residents of Kolkata & beyond.
It is the dream of welcoming new members into the fellowship of our church family – loving, learning, laughing and living in harmony together.
It is the dream of developing people to spiritual maturity through Bible studies, small groups, seminars, foundation course, retreats, etc
