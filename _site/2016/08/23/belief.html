			<h1>What we believe</h1>
		</header>
		
		<p><p><strong>The Bible</strong></p>

<p>We believe in the Divine verbal inspiration of the Scriptures, the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments. We accept them as infallible, believing that these contain the only record of God’s dealing with man and His will for man. We believe that these tell the only true way of salvation. We believe that these were given to men who wrote them as led by the Holy Spirit of God every thought and words recorded, were inspired by Him, then simply written down by men. ( 2 Peter 1:21; Matt 5:18; 2 Tim.2:16; Titus 1:2; I Thess. 2:13; Jeremiah 1:9; Prov. 30:56; II Sam. 23:2; Mark 12:30; Acts 4:25; Rev. 22:18-19)</p>

<p><strong>Godhead</strong></p>

<p>We believe in the existence of One and Only One living and true God, an infinite intelligent Spirit having a definite and distinctive personality. We believe that He is the Creator of all things and that He is the Supreme Ruler of His creation, inexpressibly glorious in His Holiness worthy of all-possible honour, confidence, adoration love worship and allegiance. (Deut. 6:4; Gen. 1:1; Isa. 40:28; John 1:3; John 4:24; Col. 1:16; I Tim. 2:5)</p>

<p><strong>Trinity</strong></p>

<p>We further believe that in the unity of the Godhead there are three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, each the same in essence, same in nature and equal in attributes with the Godhead, each exercising distinct but harmonious offices in the work of creation, redemption and salvation. (Gen. 1:26; Isa. 9:6; John 1:1; John 10:30; Acts 5:34; Phil 2:6; Col. 2:9; I John 5:7)</p>

<p><strong>Jesus Christ</strong></p>

<p>We believe that Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary and of the Holy Ghost, pure, undefiled, and that He is God manifest in the flesh. He became man without ceasing to be God, in order that He might reveal God (Isa. 9:6; Matt.1:18-25; Luke 1:26-37; John 1:1-14; Rev. 19:13; I Tim. 3:16; I John 5:7; Isa. 7:14)
We believe in the sacrificial substitutionary death of Jesus Christ upon the cross to make atonement for sin by the offering of Himself and shedding of His blood once and for all. We believe that He did no sin, but bore the penalty for our sons and for the sins of the world, God punishing Him instead of the sinner. We believe in His literal bodily resurrection, triumphant over death, hell and grave; His ascension into heaven, His intercession for us in Heaven; His offer to of life through His Spirit (Eze. 18:20; Rom. 6:23; I John 3:4; Isa. 53:4-8,10; Lev. 17:11; Rom.2:23-25; Heb. 10:1-18; I Peter 2:24; Heb. 9:11-28; I Peter 1:18,19; I Cor. 15:38; Luke 24:51; Acts 1: 10-11; Heb. 7:25; Rom. 8:34; Col. 1:27; II Cor. 13:5)</p>

<p><strong>Holy Spirit</strong></p>

<p>We believe in the person, Deity and power of the Holy Spirit, that He is one with the Godhead. (I John 5:7; Acts 5:34; John 14:26; I Cor. 2:11)
We believe in the necessity and efficiency of His work in the enlightenment, sanctification, regeneration and glorification of each believer. He comforts and seals those who believe in Jesus. (John 3:5; John 6:44; John 16:6-11; I Cor 2;11-14; I Cor. 12:13; Rom. 6:9-11; Acts 1:8; John 15:26; John 14: 16-17)
We believe He came forth from the Father, at the request of the Son, to convict the world of sin, righteousness and judgement.</p>

<p><strong>Salvation</strong></p>

<p>We believe that the only approach that man can make to God is through the death and blood of Jesus Christ, that He alone can offer forgiveness of sins by the sacrifice of Himself; that unless forgiven through Him, man is hopelessly and eternally lost. (Acts 4:11; John 14;6; John 5: 39-40; John 6:28-29; John 3:35; Acts 13:38-39; Acts 16:3; Romans 8:7-9; Romans 3: 19-20; II Cor. 13:5; Hebrews 10:1-31)</p>

<p>We believe that in order to be saved a man must confess that he himself is a sinner, hopelessly lost, totally incapable of saving himself and entirely dependent upon the merits of Jesus Christ as his substitute in death and his substitute in life. He must call upon the name of the Lord for salvation; that mere belief in Christ or about Christ is not enough, but that each individual must appropriate for himself the salvation that is in Christ by receiving Him as personal Savior (Lev. 26:40-41; John 3:35; Rom. 7:4; 8:10; Eph. 2:8-12; gal. 2:20; Rom. 4:25; 10:13; John 1:12; 6:47; Rev. 3:20; John 3:15-16)</p>

<p><strong>New Birth</strong></p>

<p>We believe that when a man meets the conditions (as mentioned above) God miraculously imparts to him a new spiritual life through the spirit of God; that this new life is known as the new birth or regeneration: that this is absolutely essential to all salvation of any man that this is not brought about by water baptism or any other act or ordinance of man but by the divine influence of the Holy Spirit either directly or indirectly through the Word of God (John 3:35; I Peter 1:23; James 1:18; I Cor. 6:9-11; Col. 1:27; Eph.2:10; Rom. 8:9-10). We believe that by this regeneration or new birth, whereby the Spirit of God takes up His abode in the believer, man receives a new life with new desires; that this new life begins a warfare against the old nature and things of the flesh to transform the individual and to make him like the Lord Jesus Christ; that this work is perfected at the appearing of Christ to receive His blood bought believers from the earth, that this work will be performed in the life of each one who truly accepts Christ as Savior. (I John 3:13; Rom. 8:29-30; I Cor. 3:16-17; 6:19-20; Gal. 5:17; Heb. 12:5-13; I Cor. 11:3-31; John 10:28-29; 6:37) Baptism in the Holy Spirit We believe in the baptism and fullness of the Holy Spirit as an essential for Christian service and as God’s command for every believer. We believe that this is received and maintained in the life of the believer by faith and obedience. We believe that the gifts of the Spirit are essential to proper Christian service. As the Lord divides to each individual that such individual is responsible to seek His enablement through spiritual gifts to edifying of the Church; that these are the sign of the fullness of the Spirit; we believe in the exercise of these gifts in love. (Eph. 5:18; Luke 11;5-13; Acts 5:32; I Cor. 12:7-11;31; Phil 2:2-13; gal. 5:16; I Cor. 14:1-12; I Cor. 13; Romans 12:1-2)</p>

<p><strong>Holiness</strong></p>

<p>We believe in holiness of life as a command from the Lord and the responsibility in every believer; that every believer must seek to shun the very appearance of evil, to have no fellowship with sin, to seek to give no offence to others, to maintain good works, to live a life of separation, to be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers, to accept admonition from the brethren and to give admonition to the brethren. (Heb. 12:14; II Peter 2:11-21; I Peter 3:8-17; I Peter 4; I Thess. 2:22; Eph. 5:11; II Cor. 6:14-18; Titus 3:5; I Cor. 19:31-33; Gal. 6:1; II Thess. 3:14-15).</p>

<p><strong>Baptism in Water</strong></p>

<p>We believe in Baptism in water by immersion and for born again believers only, as identification with the Lord in His death, burial and resurrection for us, but to a far greater extent, a picture of consecration. Thus the believer shows forth his desire and will to commit his body into the hands of the Holy Spirit seeking His power and walking by His power in a life of holiness unto the Lord. (Romans 6:1-13; John 3:33; Matt. 3:16; Acts 19:1-6; Matt. 28:19-20).</p>

<p>Holy Communion : We believe in the worthy participation in the Holy Communion by all born again believers (Bread &amp; Wine being symbolic of the Body and Blood of Jesus) This is their duty and privilege to remember His death till He comes again (I Cor. 11:23-34)</p>

<p><strong>The Second Coming of Jesus</strong></p>

<p>We believe in the personal bodily return of Jesus Christ in appearing in the air for His bride, the Church, and His coming in glory. We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; those that are saved to the resurrection of eternal life and those that are lost to the resurrection of eternal damnation. (I Thess. 4:13-18; John 14:1-3; Zech. 14:1-9; Acts 1:10-11; Luke 11:39; Rev. 20:6; I Cor. 15:51-52)
receiving Him as personal Savior (Lev. 26:40-41; John 3:35; Rom. 7:4; 8:10; Eph. 2:8-12; gal. 2:20; Rom. 4:25; 10:13; John 1:12; 6:47; Rev. 3:20; John 3:15-16)</p>
