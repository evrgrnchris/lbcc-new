			<h1>Our Core Values</h1>
		</header>
		
		<p><p><strong>Value of Covenant</strong></p>

<p>Upon receiving salvation man becomes bonded to God. The LORD makes all the arrangements and graciously offers His salvation-covenant to us. We submit in obedience to the terms of His covenant bond and in return we receive His covenant mercy, faithfulness and loving-kindness
When we enter into God’s covenant with His Son it brings us into a covenant relationship with one another. These covenant bonds exist between all believers and we are responsible to love all Christians. However, within the local church, we have the unique opportunity to experience the challenges and blessings of committed relationships being worked out in practical ways on a day-to-day basis.
God’s Holy Spirit generates and maintains this bond of love between us. We learn to walk in His covenant love but aren’t responsible for creating it…</p>

<p><strong>Value of Kingdom of God</strong></p>

<p>Jesus Christ is a sovereign and current ruler over the entire universe and all things within it. He alone is responsible for establishing His kingdom; however, the administration of His kingdom is through appointed leaders and all those who serve Christ by the gifts and enabling of the Holy Spirit.
The Kingdom of God is eternal, permanent and unshakable. Further, His kingdom stands, unmovable and indestructible, influencing the human structures of family, church government and the market place.</p>

<p><strong>Value of Biblical Authority</strong></p>

<p>God’s revelation to mankind carries the authority inherent in His Person and Nature. Therefore, His statements concerning the created order, people, and life-styles are definitive. God shares His authority with those who fill certain roles within His Kingdom.
When we receive His authority, we receive with it the responsibility and accountability God demands. Those who abuse God’s authority face the consequences of His displeasure and discipline. Jesus describes the misuse of authority as leaders who make people feel the burdensome weight of their authority.</p>

<p>Value of Fatherhood</p>

<p>God the Father expresses His own fatherhood through Jesus Christ (the eternally begotten Son) and through all men on earth. His fatherly image pervades all men and stands revealed among all nations (tribes and societies) on earth. The responsibility that God the Father exercises over the entire human population. He shares with men as they lay down their lives for their wives and children. God the Father also shares His fatherhood in the spheres of business, education, profession, military ad etc.</p>

<p><strong>Value of Family</strong></p>

<p>God has created the family as a mirror image to that of Jesus Christ and His Church. Even as Christ is the Head of His Church, so also the Husband/Father is the head of his family. Even as Christ lays down His life for the Church, so also the Husband/father lays down his life for his own wife and children. The wife submits to her husband as to Jesus Christ. The Husband/father carries the responsibility before Jesus Christ for leading his wife and children in the ways of Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Value of being Single</strong></p>

<p>While the universal and general purpose for all people would be to pursue a married life, in certain cases and under special conditions, God’s purposes and values are also fulfilled in those who by the Spirit’s gifting, live and serve God as single people.
God especially covers and supplies the widow and the orphan and places single people under the protection of house-holds within the local church.</p>

<p><strong>Value of Distinctive Gender Roles</strong></p>

<p>God, out of His own Nature and in His revealed Word, has defined gender roles for people on earth.
The Scriptures define roles for men and women distinctly and specifically. The uniqueness of each role reflects the Image of God in men and women “equal in value but distinct in roles”. To confuse or exchange God-given roles brings confusion and self-destruction into society, whether the individual, family, local church, city or state. The God-given role carries the anointing and enabling of God for personal growth, fulfilment and success in God’s kingdom on earth.
(We believe that the role of church government is distinctively given to men and not to women)</p>

<p><strong>Value of Personal Responsibility</strong></p>

<p>God gives to each of His children a sphere of work (calling) with accountability for the responsibility given. Jesus continually exhorts believers to comprehend, enter into, and fulfil their calling. Believers, by their own initiative, reach out for God’s sphere of activity in their lives and seed to fulfil the unique destiny He has ordained for them.
Value of Pastoral Care</p>

<p>For each member of the Body Christ, a Spirit-gifted pastoral leader should be available. The ministry of pastoral care is to enable each believer to enter the maturation process, comprehend their destiny in God, become equipped for ministry and engage the sphere of ministry God has chosen for him or her. The pastor’s role is to intercede for, teach, exhort and confront as necessary. The pastor responds to the believer’s needs, providing loving care, oversight and wise counsel from the Scriptures and out of fellowship with his own circle of leaders to whom he is accountable. As the Great Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep, so the pastor is to lay down his own life for those in his care.</p>

<p><strong>Value of Discipleship</strong></p>

<p>Every believer is to yield his life to Christ’s leadership and training by asking to become accountable in his personal life and ministry to fellow pastors or workers. As with Jesus’ disciples, so with us.
Productive Discipleship has an overall focus, specific goals and time limit.
Personal Discipleship refers to developing a person’s individual walk with God in one’s family, church and business.
Training Discipleship refers to the process of identifying a person’s gifts and calling and equipping that person for serving God.</p>

<p><strong>Value of Servanthood</strong></p>

<p>The Isaiah hymns (Isaiah 42-53) set forth the character of the Messiah. He is God’s servant. Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, came to earth to serve the purposes of His Father; Jesus explicitly states that the greatest worker in His Father’s kingdom is the servant. Paul the Apostle presents the great servant hymn (Philippians 2) as the model for our lives as Christian men and women. The servant-leader is the only model for those who oversee the flock of God.
Servant-hood means that we expend our lives furthering God’s purposes by the power of the Holy Spirit. Servant-hood draws upon our time, our energies, and our resources to serve God without expectation of earthly reward.
In a special way we first serve the needs of the members of the Church, and then we serve the needs of our society. In practiced humility, we give preference to others by considering their needs as priority over ours. And as servants with studied endurance, we bear the sufferings which rightly fall to all those who follow Jesus Christ in truth.
Value of the Gifts of the Spirit</p>

<p>Jesus Christ continues to distribute, as He wishes, the gifts of the Holy Spirit throughout His Church on earth. The gift of the Holy Spirit enables people to come to Christ, to mature as believers, to form into fellowship groups and churches, to minister the grace of God to one another, to equip for ministry and to carry God’s word to the entire world. The gifts of the Spirit enable the believer to focus his life’ energies on what God is saying and what God is doing, rather than one’s own intellect, training or experience.</p>

<p><strong>Value of Worship</strong></p>

<p>God draws us to approach Him through progressive stages of thanksgiving, praise and worship. Worship may take the form quiet and silent adoration of joyous effusive shouting; of majestic and stately glorifying. Spirit- guided worship provides the context in which the gifts of the spirit emerge, especially the prophetic word. Believers who engage worship in the Spirit also engage the Life and Breath of the Spirit, as well as the truth about God.</p>

<p><strong>Value of Small Groups</strong></p>

<p>Clusters of believers within a local church meet together regularly for personal edification or for training in specific areas of ministry. Small groups can enhance the growth and ministry of the local church by attracting the unchurched, by providing training for potential leaders and by focusing believers on equipping for service.
Value of Mission</p>

<p>God has given to local churches the responsibility to engage the worldwide mission of the church, as stated by Jesus Christ just before His ascension:
(Acts 1:8) “But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”
Outreach as expressed in local evangelism, church planting, short-term mission and career missionaries all contribute to the fulfilment of the Great Commission for the local church.
(Matthew 28:19-20) “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”</p>

<p><strong>Value of Education</strong></p>

<p>God gives to the leadership team of the local church the responsibility and gifting for equipping God’s people for the work of the ministry. The Word of God provides the mindset and content. The local church carries the gifting to train the people of God to serve Him appropriately and to confront the local society and nation. God’s gifts upon the local men and women determine just how the local church engages this process. It is primarily the responsibility of parents to educate their children; however the local church can support and enhance the parent’s responsibility by providing the following: (1) marriage and parenting classes, (2) adult and children’s Sunday School, (3) Christian Day School, (4) home schooling support, (5) Bible training for missions, and (6) Bible training in theology.</p>

<p><strong>Value of “Priesthood of Every Believer”</strong></p>

<p>Implying that every individual can directly worship God without the intervention and necessity of any human mediator. Both men and women are “royal priesthood” before God. The Leaders only play the role of being equippers and carry the government.
Value of Being Sons in the Lord</p>

<p>Just as a natural born son carries the name, values, distinctive, family genes of the father and the household, so also do we value the spiritual sons to embrace the values, distinctive and family genes of the Spiritual Leader. This we term it as “carrying the heart of another”…</p>

<p><strong>Value of Proper Structure</strong></p>

<p>“New wine being poured into new wineskins.” We value the importance of providing suitable structures at each stage in the growth of a church, to ensure the proper growth at each stage. We see the value of closing down the form of a particular kind of meeting which was useful in the past but now ceases to promote increase and growth, and substituting it with another pattern of a meeting which serves the purpose of taking the people on to the next stage of growth. Though the principles never change, the forms and style of the meetings change over a period of time.
Value of Relationships</p>

<p>That we build is essential relational, because we believe that the local church is an expression of God’s wider universal family. Hence the words like “belonging”, “commitment to the church”, “body-function” etc. will be essential. A wide scope is given to practice different action words depicted by the words associated with the phrase “one another” in the Bible.</p>

<p><strong>Value of Good Works</strong></p>

<p>Depicted by the latter half of the greatest commandment “to Love thy neighbour as thyself”- Expressed in numerous ways to show God’s care, and by supplying needs without any strings attached</p>
